Creating video games through programming has always been a hobby of mine. I have big dreams on what video games I could create, such as a game similar to the procedurally animated platforming-game Rain World, based off of a separate short story I've been writing as a hobby. However, such a game would be incredibly complex, and it's easier to start with something simpler- in this case, a game where the player is a bacterium and explores the environment that is the human body. My end goal is something similar to the game Bond Breaker by TestTubeGames- not needlessly accurate, but something that could get the interest and attention of young, potential science enthusiasts. I would ideally have this completed before the start of junior year.
I will use my computer programming knowledge and Github to help me accomplish this task. I am constantly adding to the broad map of what the features of the game would look like, but implementing these requires careful planning, and there are some completely new techniques that I would need to learn. I would like to add features that require me to exercise certain skills I learned in USACO. Github also conveniently stores each instance of me adding to my project, so I can use that to record my progress.
